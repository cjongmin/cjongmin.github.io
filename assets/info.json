    "bio": "Hello! I am Jongmin Choi, a master's student in the Multimodal AI (MMAI) Laboratory at KAIST.\n My research focuses on understanding and mitigating the modality gap observed in multimodal models, aiming to leverage cross-modal synergy more effectively.\n\n I have explored approaches to reduce distributional gaps through embedding-level diffusion in audio captioning tasks, and through CS-divergence and alignment-based loss functions that improve consistency between modalities. In particular, my work involves guiding large language models (LLMs) using logit-level aligned embeddings to enhance multimodal representation learning.\n\n Currently, I am also interested in spiking neural networks (SNNs) that better reflect the behavior of biological neurons. My ongoing research focuses on modeling Generalized Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (GLIF) neurons and developing spiking neural architectures based on them.",

        <h1>ICCV 2025 Hawaii ‚Äî A Journey Through Computer Vision</h1>
        <div class="post-meta" style="margin-bottom: 32px;">October 15, 2025 ‚Ä¢ Conference, Travel, Multimodal Learning</div>
        
        <p>
          Attending ICCV 2025 in Honolulu, Hawaii was an unforgettable experience. This year's conference brought together the brightest minds in computer vision, and I had the privilege of witnessing groundbreaking research presentations, engaging in thought-provoking discussions, and exploring new directions in multimodal AI.
        </p>

        <h2>Conference Highlights</h2>
        
        <p>
          The keynote by Prof. Fei-Fei Li on "Vision-Language Models at Scale" was particularly inspiring. She discussed how the next generation of multimodal systems will bridge the gap between visual understanding and language generation in ways we haven't imagined yet. Her insights on reducing the modality gap‚Äîsomething I've been deeply interested in‚Äîresonated strongly with my own research direction.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also attended several workshops focused on audio-visual learning and spiking neural networks. The workshop on "Efficient Visual Recognition" featured fascinating talks on leveraging biological neural principles to build more energy-efficient vision models. This aligns perfectly with my current work on GLIF neurons and SNNs.
        </p>

        <h2>Networking and Collaborations</h2>
        
        <p>
          One of the most valuable aspects of ICCV was the opportunity to meet researchers from around the world. I had productive conversations with teams from MIT, Stanford, and Meta AI about potential collaborations on multimodal representation learning. We discussed novel approaches to alignment-based loss functions that could push the boundaries of cross-modal consistency.
        </p>

        <h2>Conference Video Highlights</h2>
        
        <p>
          I captured some memorable moments from the conference, including the beautiful venue overlooking Waikiki Beach and snippets from poster sessions. Here's a short compilation:

        </div>

        <h2>Research Takeaways</h2>
        
        <p>
          Several key themes emerged from this year's conference:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Multimodal Alignment:</strong> Multiple papers explored new techniques for aligning visual and linguistic representations, moving beyond simple contrastive learning.</li>
          <li><strong>Efficient Models:</strong> There's growing interest in building vision models that are both accurate and computationally efficient, with particular attention to neural architecture search and pruning techniques.</li>
          <li><strong>Biological Plausibility:</strong> An increasing number of researchers are drawing inspiration from neuroscience to design more robust and interpretable vision systems.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Beyond the Conference</h2>
        
        <p>
          Hawaii's natural beauty provided the perfect backdrop for creative thinking. Between sessions, I took walks along the beach, which gave me time to reflect on how the ideas presented could influence my own work. There's something about being near the ocean that helps clarify complex research problems!
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm already looking forward to ICCV 2026 and the opportunity to present my own research on modality gap reduction and spiking neural networks. Until then, I have plenty of new ideas to explore back at the MMAI Lab.
